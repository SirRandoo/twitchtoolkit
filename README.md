## Building

To build the mod, you will need the following:

- [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) if you’re not on Windows.
- [.NET 4.7.2 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472) if you're on Windows.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/)
- Your favorite IDE.

We recognize people’s games are different, so we’ve provided properties you may change if the project doesn’t build for
you:

- `ToolkitCoreDir` is a property that points to the directory where your copy of ToolkitCore is located.
- `SteamRootDir` is a property that points to the directory where your copy of Steam is located.

You may set either of these properties at build time in your IDE, or through the command line:

- Command line: `msbuild /p:ToolkitCoreDir=C:\path\to\toolkitcore ...`
- IDE: Refer to your IDE’s documentation on how to set global properties.
